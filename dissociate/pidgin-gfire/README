Gfire is an advanced open-source Xfire plugin for the popular Pidgin IM client.
It allows you to connect and communicate on the Xfire network, using the Pidgin IM client. You can now IM all your Xfire friends, as well as on MSN, 
Yahoo, AIM and many more!
Why have a separate Xfire client to use Xfire, why not have all your IM accounts in one place!

This requires purple-plugin_pack, Glib2 ( needed version found in gsb repo ) and GTK+2 ( needed version found in gsb repo ).
