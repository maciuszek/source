This is a prototype of an IRCCloud desktop app for Windows, 
Linux (Debian/Ubuntu), and macOS. The app wraps the IRCCloud 
website in a native window.

This app is currently experimental and is not officially supported, 
however it should provide equivalent or better functionality to 
other IRCCloud desktop wrapper apps.
