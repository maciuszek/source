djmount is a UPnP AV client. It mounts as a Linux filesystem the media 
content of compatible UPnP AV devices.
Djmount discovers automatically all UPnP AV Media Servers on the network, 
and make the content available in a directory tree. All shared files (e.g. 
Audio or Video files) are directly visible and can be played using your 
favorite media player.
