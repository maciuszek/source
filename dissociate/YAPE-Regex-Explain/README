This module merely sub-classes YAPE::Regex, and produces a rather verbose explanation of a regex, suitable for 
demonstration and tutorial purposes.

The YAPE hierarchy of modules is an attempt at a unified means of parsing and extracting content. It attempts to 
maintain a generic interface, to promote simplicity and reusability. The API is powerful, yet simple. The modules do 
tokenization (which can be intercepted) and build trees, so that extraction of specific nodes is doable.
