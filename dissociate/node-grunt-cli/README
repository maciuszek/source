Grunt is a task-based tool that speeds up 
workflows by reducing the effort required to prepare 
assets for javascript production. It does this by 
wrapping up jobs into tasks that are compiled 
automatically as you go along. Basically, you can use 
Grunt on most tasks that you consider to be grunt work 
and would normally have to manually configure 
and run yourself.

Grunt is built ontop of Node.js.
