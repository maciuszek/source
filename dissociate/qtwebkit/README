WebKit is an open source web browser engine. WebKit's HTML and JavaScript code 
began as a branch of the KHTML and KJS libraries from 
KDE. As part of KDE framework KHTML was based on Qt but during their porting e
fforts Apple's engineers made WebKit toolkit independent. 
QtWebKit is a project aiming at porting this fabulous engine back to Qt.

The Qt port of WebKit currently compiles and runs on Linux, Windows and Mac OS X. 

Slackware QT *should* be rebuilt with webkit disabled and or ignored.

This must be built against the default slackware gstreamer-0.10.36-i486-2.
If gstreamer1-1.4.5-i486-1_SBo is installed, remove it prior to building this. 
After it can be reinstalled.
