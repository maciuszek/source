Unified Linux Driver for Samsung printers and scanners.

After installation you need to add 'smfp' to /etc/sane.d/dll.conf
Command: "echo smfp >> /etc/sane.d/dll.conf"

This requires libstdc++5 ( in slackware repos part of gcc-4.4.4-i486-1 ), 
libtiff ( in slackware repos ), cups ( in slackware repos ), ghostscript ( in slackware repos ) 
and sane ( in slackware repos ).

Optional requirements are hal-cups-utils ( Allows scanner and printer functions with cups>=1.4 
without blocking usblp ).
