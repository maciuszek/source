PyQt is the binding of the GUI toolkit Qt.

PyQt is developed by the British firm Riverbank Computing. It is
available under similar terms as Qt, this means variety of licenses
including GPL and commercial license. PyQt supports Linux and other
flavours of Unix, as well as Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows.

This package contains bindings for version 4 of Qt toolkit, and thus
requires both qt4 and sip from SlackBuilds.org.

This will overrid and possibly corrupt the pyqt packaged with slackware.
This can optially be integrate with python2 if it is installed. Set PYTHON_VER=2
prior to build.
