This module is yet another (?) parser and tree-builder for Perl regular expressions. It builds a tree out of a regex, 
but at the moment, the extent of the extraction tool for the tree is quite limited. However, the tree can be useful 
to extension modules.

The YAPE hierarchy of modules is an attempt at a unified means of parsing and extracting content. It attempts to 
maintain a generic interface, to promote simplicity and reusability. The API is powerful, yet simple. The modules do 
tokenization (which can be intercepted) and build trees, so that extraction of specific nodes is doable.
