explore nux: *** Warning: Linking the shared library libnux-4.0.la against the static 
library /usr/lib/libz.a is not portable!

explore a cleaner solution to have hud finding libgsettings-qt.so; the current solution soft 
linking /usr/lib/qt5/lib/libgsettings-qt.so.1.0.0 library to /usr/lib/

merge existing duplicate build scripts caused with the inclusion of pam

maybe merge some unstable build scripts due to pam reliance (since vbatts pam is needed by unity 
itself anyway)

bamf needs to be edited since bamwatcher.c relies on pacman

gnome-session-ubuntu might explicitly need to ignore wayland

colord needs to include README specifying the creation of a user (look at SlackBuild)

compiz "might" need a SlackBuild relook

gnome-control-center "might" need to be relooked (look at SlackBuild)

libindicator "might" SlackBuild might need to be relooked; both withgtk3 and withgtk2 install 
in the same path.. check all other packges with build incase the same issues exists

unity "might" need to be looked over (CMake is a headach) && chrpath

unity-language-packs "might" need a SlackBuild relook

check all the find ops in SlackBuilds (fix anything that was simply failing due to missing \;)
