man-db (database-driven manual pager suite)

This package provides the man command and related utilities for examining
on-line help files (manual pages). It can act as a replacement for
Slackware's man package. It has several enhancements over man, including
an indexed database, the ability to easily view man pages in a browser,
and better i18n support.

This build includes a complete install of libpipeline.

By default, man-db doesn't conflict with Slackware's man package. See
README.Slackware for details.
